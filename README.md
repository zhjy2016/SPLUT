# SPLUT
Official code for ECCV2022 paper: Learning Series-Parallel Lookup Tables for Efficient Image Super-Resolution

The folder `training_testing_code` contains the code for training SPLUT, transferring mapping modules to LUTs, and testing SPLUT models in the `training_testing_code` folder. 
The users can follow the descriptions in [readme.md](https://github.com/zhjy2016/SPLUT/blob/main/training_testing_code/readme.md) to train and test the SP-LUT models. 

In order to evaluate the SR efficiency on mobile phones, we have designed demos for SPLUT and SR-LUT. The code is also released and is in the demo code folder. 
By following the guides in [readme_demo.md](https://github.com/zhjy2016/SPLUT/blob/main/demo_code/readme_demo.md), the users can generate the corresponding APK files for testing.
